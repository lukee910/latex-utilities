# Templates

## Usage

Add `\input{path/to/template}` at the very beginning of your file.

## For authors

These files should be usable with `\input` to set up a document. They should _not_ be used with copy-paste, so that any change to the template can be easily used in an existing file.

Templates should include:

```latex
% === Document class
% === Packages
% === Utilites from this repo
% === Commands and definitions
% === Template styling
```
