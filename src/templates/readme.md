# Templates

## Usage

To use a template, aadd `\input{path/to/template}` at the _very_ beginning of your file. They already include the document class.

Templates shouldn't be copy-pasted. With `\input`, any updates to the templates will also be applied to any existing document.

Templates should include:

```latex
% === Document class
% === Packages
% === Utilites from this repo
% === Commands and definitions
% === Template styling
```
